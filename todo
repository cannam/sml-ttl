  % fix
  collection serialisation (test/spec/turtle-syntax-lists-05.ttl)

coding/naming standards:

 * signatures LIKE_THIS and they go in file.sig (but there may also be
 non-public signatures in file.sml)

 * structures and functors LikeThis and LikeThisFn

 * functions like_this? maybe public ones likeThis?

 * src/subdir.mlb is build file for src/subdir/*.sml ?

pull out sml-utf8, sml-log, trie to separate repos

unit tests for trie

sml-utf8 tests, and add support for 5 and 6 byte encodings?

rename from sml-ttl to... what?

tidy up tests, so they all have a similar layout (test-collection may
be a good example)

extend test coverage

licence & copyright in top of source files & in COPYING etc

"where" clauses in signature expressions to avoid having to
over-specify structure types

ensure abbreviation does not produce any local part with "/" in it (or
other pname local part excluded / escaped chars? - what's the right
way to do this?)
