  % fix
  collection serialisation (test/spec/turtle-syntax-lists-05.ttl)

coding/naming standards:

 * signatures LIKE_THIS and they go in file.sig (but there may also be
 non-public signatures in file.sml)

 * structures and functors LikeThis and LikeThisFn

 * functions like_this? maybe public ones likeThis?

 * src/subdir.mlb is build file for src/subdir/*.sml ?

pull out sml-log, test-support to separate repos

rename from sml-ttl to... what?

extend test coverage

licence & copyright in top of source files & in COPYING etc

"where" clauses in signature expressions to avoid having to
over-specify structure types

review http://mlton.org/ObjectOrientedProgramming for ideas for
dynamic dispatch for I/O functions
