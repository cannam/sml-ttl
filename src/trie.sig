signature PATTERN_MATCH_TRIE = sig

    (* A trie that can do pattern matches as well as prefix
       matches. Say you have a trie containing some (conceptual)
       list/string entries matching ABB, ABC, and BBC. With the plain
       trie you can match e.g. prefix AB to return ABB and ABC. With a
       pattern-match trie you can alternatively provide a query list
       like [NONE, SOME B, NONE] to return all entries having three
       elements with B in the middle, here all three of the listed
       entries.

       This differs from the plain trie not only because of the
       additional pattern match function, but also because the type of
       the individual elements is exposed, whereas TRIE uses an atomic
       entry type. *)
